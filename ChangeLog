TuxGuitar-dev 1.2 changes :
* keyboard number typing trick for the note edition with numbers 0-9 without NumLock
(for numbers, not only the keys are interpreted but their resulting values too;
for example on French keyboard "Shift-&" is not really the key "1",
for SWT it is "&" with the modifier "Shift" but its value is "1")
* Unix-like selection with key 'c' : when typing 'c', the caret begin a selection and some 'how to' tips appear on the tablature 
* Direct copy of selected or previous notes with key 'd'
* Deletion of all notes on the selected beat with 'Shift-d'
* Mute of all notes on the string in the measure with 'Alt-p'
* Tie of all notes on the beats in the measure with 'Shift-l'
* Ghosting of all notes on the beat with 'Shift-o'
